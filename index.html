            <h1>GIANLUCA BARSAGLINI</h1>
            <h2>Welcome!
                A bit about my self!
            </h2>
            <p>I am an enthusiastic IT professional with a flair for blending software development and project management. 
                My journey in the tech world has been a global adventure, reflecting my adaptability and diverse skill set. 
                From managing operations in the bustling city of Toronto to developing software solutions in Italy, each 
                experience has enriched my understanding of technology in different cultural contexts.

                What excites me most about technology is its potential to solve complex problems and streamline processes. 
                My experience in agile methodologies and data analytics has not only honed my technical skills but also 
                sharpened my strategic thinking. Whether it was enhancing operational efficiency in Toronto or navigating 
                the challenges of running a business in Italy during the pandemic, each role has been a valuable lesson in 
                resilience and innovation.
                
                Fluency in multiple languages, including Italian, English, and Portuguese, coupled with my studies in Japanese, 
                have broadened my perspective, allowing me to communicate and collaborate effectively in diverse environments. 
                My academic pursuits, like my ongoing Bachelor's in Computer Science, reflect my commitment to continuous learning.
                
                While my certifications in Project Management, Full Stack Development, and Data Analytics are a testament to my 
                technical competence, it's the hands-on experiences and the challenges I've overcome that truly define my professional 
                journey. I thrive in environments that value innovation and creativity, and I am always eager to explore how technology 
                can drive business growth in new and exciting ways.
