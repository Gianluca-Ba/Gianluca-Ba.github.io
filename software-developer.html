                                <li>In the full-stack capstone project, a comprehensive solution architecture is implemented using multiple 
                                    technologies. The core of the project is a Django application, which provides a user-friendly interface 
                                    accessible through a web browser. User authentication is managed within this application, utilizing 
                                    SQLite as the persistence layer for storing essential data like car makes and models. The application 
                                    also integrates cloud-based services. Specifically, IBM Cloud functions are employed to manage data 
                                    related to dealerships and reviews stored in Cloudant, a NoSQL document-based database. These functions 
                                    facilitate operations such as retrieving and posting dealership reviews. The Django framework plays a 
                                    pivotal role, not only in rendering dynamic pages for displaying dealers, reviews, and adding new r
                                    eviews but also in acting as a bridge between the user interface and cloud services. This integration 
                                    is achieved through a set of proxy services within Django, which communicate with IBM Cloud Functions, 
                                    thereby seamlessly connecting the front-end and back-end components. The application's functionality is 
                                    rigorously tested both locally and on a Cloud IDE to ensure a smooth, efficient, and reliable user 
                                    experience.
