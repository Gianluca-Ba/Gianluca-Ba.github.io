                                    services. The core functionality involves two primary functions. These functions are rigorously tested through written unit tests to ensure 
                                    accuracy and reliability. To maintain high coding standards, a coding standards check is performed against 
                                    these functions.

                                    The user inputs a starting population size and a target population size. The program then calculates the number 
                                    of years required for the population to reach or surpass the target size based on a simple model: each year, the 
                                    population grows by one-third of its current size (new births) and decreases by a quarter of its current size (deaths).

                                <li> This project involves creating a text-based version of the pyramid scene from World 1-1 in Nintendo's 
                                    Super Mario Brothers using the C programming language. The program, named mario, constructs a right-aligned 
                                    pyramid of hashes (#) to represent bricks. The height of the pyramid is determined by user input, which must 
                                    be a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive. The program prompts the user for this input and keeps 
                                    re-prompting until a valid integer is provided. Depending on the input, the pyramid's height adjusts accordingly, 
                                    with each level adding one more hash to create the pyramid shape. This project is an excellent example of using 
                                    loops and conditional statements in C to handle user input and output a structured text representation.

                                    The task is to create a website with at least four HTML pages, including an index.html, ensuring navigability 
                                    between all pages. The site must use over ten distinct HTML tags and integrate elements from Bootstrap for aesthetic

                                <li> This project involves enhancing a Minesweeper game with an AI component, using Python. The game consists of two main files: 
                                    runner.py, which handles the graphical interface, and minesweeper.py, containing the game's logic and AI functions. The Minesweeper 
                                    class, already fully implemented, manages gameplay mechanics. The Sentence class represents logical statements about the game board,

                                <li>In the full-stack capstone project, a comprehensive solution architecture is implemented using multiple 
                                    technologies. The core of the project is a Django application, which provides a user-friendly interface 
                                    accessible through a web browser. User authentication is managed within this application, utilizing 
                                    SQLite as the persistence layer for storing essential data like car makes and models. The application 
                                    also integrates cloud-based services. Specifically, IBM Cloud functions are employed to manage data 
                                    related to dealerships and reviews stored in Cloudant, a NoSQL document-based database. These functions 
                                    facilitate operations such as retrieving and posting dealership reviews. The Django framework plays a 
                                    pivotal role, not only in rendering dynamic pages for displaying dealers, reviews, and adding new r
                                    eviews but also in acting as a bridge between the user interface and cloud services. This integration 
                                    is achieved through a set of proxy services within Django, which communicate with IBM Cloud Functions, 
                                    thereby seamlessly connecting the front-end and back-end components. The application's functionality is 
                                    rigorously tested both locally and on a Cloud IDE to ensure a smooth, efficient, and reliable user 
                                    experience.

                                <li> This project involves developing a parser for English sentences using context-free grammar (CFG) in Python, 
                                    leveraging the nltk library. The main tasks include defining CFG rules in the NONTERMINALS global variable 
                                    to parse various sentence structures, implementing the preprocess function to tokenize and clean input sentences, 
                                    and creating the np_chunk function to identify noun phrase chunks within a parsed sentence tree. The objective is 
                                    to create a parser capable of understanding the structure of sentences, an essential aspect of natural language 
                                    processing. This project offers practical experience in CFG, sentence parsing, and working with linguistic data structures.

                                    <li>This project involves creating a Student Advisor chatbot using Watson Assistant, integrated with GitHub through 
                                        webhooks and a Python script. The key steps include setting up a GitHub repository, uploading a provided JSON 
                                        file (containing course information) to this repository, and configuring Watson Assistant to fetch responses 
                                        directly from GitHub. The chatbot is designed to respond with course recommendations based on user queries. 
                                        The assignment is evaluated on various criteria, including the proper setup of the GitHub repository and Watson 
                                        Assistant, successful webhook integration, and the chatbot's ability to handle specific course-related queries 
                                        and typical conversational interactions like greetings and expressions of gratitude.
